# Avenue for no matches found

# Make arguments for different inputs
    # Make default of time input the most recent run

# Can filter by date, project, etc. 
    # Then grab list of all id/name of runs that match criteria (can export filtered data to file, maybe dataframe?)
    # Then use that to grab sample sheet (for loop?)

# Example of basespace CLI code to get information I need
# $ bs list datasets -F Project.Name -F AppSession.Name -F AppSession.DateCompleted --filter-field=Project.Name --filter-term=WaitingforQC
